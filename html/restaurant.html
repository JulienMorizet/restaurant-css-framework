        <h1>Our history and what we stand for</h1>
        <p>The first Emerald Grove restaurant opened in 1967 in San Francisco.<br>
        The original idea was to provide healthy and fresh food while
        following the cycle of the seasons.<br>
        This concept was a success and a second restaurant was opened in Los Angeles<br>
        in the early 1970's. The 21st century saw the expansion of the franchise<br>
        to the East coast with openings in the capital and in New York City.</p>

        <p>We do not only care about the environment and the health of our custommers,<br>
        we also take pride in the working conditions and the well being of our staff.<br>This is 
        the reason why we pay a living wage to all of our employees and we provide different<br> 
        training programs in order for them to develop new skills</p>
