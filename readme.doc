Website of a fictive restaurant franchise, mostly made with Bootstrap 4 during the fourth week of the Becode training 
program at the beginning of september 2019 (4 day long assignement).

Unfinished project: missing icon in the submit button, missing map, maybe new font to be added/large images 
to be resized. The display of some pages for larger screens could be improved.
